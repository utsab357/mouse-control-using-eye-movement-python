## README for Eye-Tracking Mouse Project

### Project Title
Eye-Tracking Mouse

### Description
This project aims to create a mouse pointer controlled by eye movements, utilizing Python and eye-tracking technology. The project leverages various libraries to detect and track the user's eye movements, translating them into cursor movements on the screen.

### Features
- **Real-time Eye Tracking**: Continuously tracks eye movements and updates the mouse pointer position.
- **Click Simulation**: Implements blink detection to simulate mouse clicks.
- **Calibration**: Offers a calibration process to ensure accurate tracking.
- **User Interface**: Provides a simple UI for users to configure settings and start tracking.

### Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**: Primary programming language for the project.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
- **MediaPipe**: For real-time face and eye tracking.
- **PyAutoGUI**: For controlling the mouse pointer and simulating clicks.

### Usage
- Launch the application and follow the on-screen instructions for calibration.
- Once calibrated, move your eyes to control the mouse pointer.
- Blink to simulate a mouse click.
